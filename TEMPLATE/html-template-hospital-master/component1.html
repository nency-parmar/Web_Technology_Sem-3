                        <h2>Acne</h2><br/>
                        <h6>Acne is a skin condition that may occur when the hair follicles become clogged with dead
                            skin and oily skin so it will further result in whiteheads, blackheads, or pimples.</h6><br/>
                        <p>The problem of acne is very common among teenagers, but it is found among people of all ages.
                            There are several acne treatments but the bumps will take time to go flat, and others may
                            pop up very soon. Acne also causes emotional distress as they are very clearly visible on
                            the face.</p><br/><br/>
                        <h6>Our treatment</h6><br/>
                        <p>
                            Depending on the severity, acne will take time to treat. The earlier you start the
                            treatment, the sooner it cures. Whiteheads, blackheads, small red, tender bumps, pimples,
                            are all symptoms of acne and you may not miss going for treatment.

                            If acnes are not treated with primary care you must visit our dermatologist for better
                            treatment. Our treatment involves prescribing you creams and ointments that will provide you
                            instant relief. We will also prescribe you vitamin supplements to reduce the chances of acne
                            occurring again. In older adults, acne may also be a symptom of an underlying disease so it
                            is required to visit the best dermatologist.
